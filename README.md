# Web Scraping Quotes

This repository contains a Python script that scrapes quotes and their authors from the [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) website and saves the extracted data to a CSV file.

## Overview

The script uses the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML content of the webpage and extract the quotes and their corresponding authors. It then stores the data in a CSV file, making it easy to access or analyze the quotes later.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `BeautifulSoup` (for parsing HTML)
- `requests` (for making HTTP requests)
- `csv` (to handle CSV file writing)

You can install the necessary libraries using the following pip command:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-quotes.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy
cd web-scraping-quotes
Run the Python script to scrape quotes and authors:
bash
Copy
python scraped_quotes.py
The quotes will be saved in a CSV file called scraped_quotes.csv in the same directory.
Code Explanation
The script sends a GET request to the URL https://quotes.toscrape.com/ using the requests library.
It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML of the page and find all quotes (inside <span class="text">) and their authors (inside <small class="author">).
The quotes and authors are written to a CSV file named scraped_quotes.csv.
Example Output (scraped_quotes.csv)
